# 🧠 Origin Take-Home Assignment — Therapist Session Dashboard
**Stack:** TypeScript · Next.js 13+ (App Router) · REST API · Postgres (Neon) · TailwindCSS  

---

## ✉️ Overview
Welcome 👋 — and thanks for taking the time to complete Origin Speech Therapy’s take-home challenge.  
This exercise mirrors real full-stack work at **Origin**: connecting clean backend APIs to polished, type-safe UIs.

You’ll build a small **Therapist Session Dashboard** using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and a provided **Neon Postgres** database.

This assignment is scoped for about **3–5 hours** of work for someone comfortable with these tools.  
Feel free to use **AI coding assistants** (Cursor, Copilot, Claude, etc.) — we care most about structure, clarity, and UX judgment.

---

## 🎯 Goal
Build a small **full-stack web app** where therapists can view and update their upcoming sessions.

You’ll:
1. Connect to a provided **Postgres database** (already seeded with mock data).  
2. Build a small **REST API** that reads and updates data.  
3. Create a **Next.js UI** that consumes that API and presents a usable dashboard.  

---

## 🧱 Database Access
You’ll receive your personal **Neon connection string** by email.

Add it to a local `.env.local` file:
```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://takehome_user:password@ep-example.neon.tech/neon?branch=takehome-yourname&sslmode=require"
```

This connects to your own isolated branch seeded with mock data for:
- Therapists  
- Patients  
- Sessions  

You can safely modify session data (read/write only — no schema changes).

---

## 🧩 Requirements

### 1️⃣ Backend (REST API)
- Connect to the provided **Postgres** database.  
- Implement at least two endpoints:
  - `GET /api/sessions` → returns all sessions (joined with therapist + patient names)
  - `PATCH /api/sessions/:id` → updates a session’s `status` (e.g. “Completed”)
- Use **TypeScript** throughout.  
- Handle validation and errors gracefully (`400 / 404 / 500`).  
- Use either **pg**, **Drizzle**, or **Prisma** for DB access.

---

### 2️⃣ Frontend (UI)
- Display sessions in a responsive table or card layout.  
- Show therapist name, patient name, date/time, and status.  
- Add a **“Mark Completed”** button calling your PATCH endpoint.  
- Include **loading**, **error**, and **empty** states.  
- Style with **TailwindCSS** — clean and readable is perfect.

---

### 3️⃣ Bonus (optional)
- Add search / filter (e.g. by therapist or status).  
- Add optimistic UI updates (update the UI immediately on click).  
- Deploy to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) or [Render](https://render.com).

## 🧱 Database Schema (for reference)

```sql
CREATE TABLE therapists (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  specialty TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  dob DATE
);

CREATE TABLE sessions (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  therapist_id INT REFERENCES therapists(id),
  patient_id INT REFERENCES patients(id),
  date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  status TEXT CHECK (status IN ('Scheduled','Completed')) DEFAULT 'Scheduled'
);
```

**Example Row**

| Therapist | Patient | Date | Status |
|------------|----------|------|--------|
| Anna SLP | Ariel Underwood | 2025-11-08 09:00 | Scheduled |
